Assign4: Due 11:59PM April 21

Design and implement a program that will simulate an electronic circuit.
A circuit may have different components, like AND, OR, NOT, etc.

A NOT will take one input and produce one output, which is the negation of the 
input. An AND will take two input and produce an output of 1 only if both the 
input are 1; 0 otherwise. An OR will take two input and produce an output of 1 
if either of the input is 1; 0 otherwise.

If an input is unconnected to an output, its value can be set to 0 or 1 by the user. If no value is set, it's assumed to be 0.

Design the program so the user can open an existing circuit or create a new 
one. They can place components of different type (more types may be added 
later) and connect them. The user can also click on a simulate button. When 
the simulation is on, any unconnected output of any component on the circuit 
should display the current state of the output. You may simulate the circuit 
on a clock tick on 1-second interval.
